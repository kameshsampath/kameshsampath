Developer Advocate at [Snowflake](https://snowflake.com). I write, speak, and build things—mostly around cloud-native and data.

I’ve spent 25+ years in enterprise software. These days I help developers and platform teams ship systems that are boring in the best way: reliable, observable, and easy to operate.

### Open source

I contribute to open source in the Kubernetes/cloud-native ecosystem, including:

- [k3d](https://k3d.io)
- [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) and [Knative](https://knative.dev)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
- [Apache Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.7.x/index.html)
- [Wolfi OS](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os)

### Topics I enjoy nerding out on

- [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (GitOps)
- [Istio](https://istio.io) (service mesh)
- [Knative](https://knative.dev) (serverless on Kubernetes)
- [Snowflake](https://snowflake.com) (data platform)
- [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) (CI/CD pipelines)
